# Django based credit rating

The aim of this app is to predict a credit risk by giving a score instead of the probability default. The back end part was made with python \textbf{django framework, scikit learn, pandas} and \textbf{bokeh} libraries. For the frond end,\textbf{html, css} and \textbf{bootstrap} were used. The grade is a transformation of probability coefficients obtained with logistic regression to the range 0-100.
